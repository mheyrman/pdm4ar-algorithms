# Planning and Decision Making for Autonomous Robots
This repository stores the main exercise code from the course Planning and Decision Making for Autonomous Robots at ETH ZÃ¼rich under Prof. Emilio Frazzoli. Over time, I will be updating this repository to include only the main algorithms that I worked on in a distilled manner. For now, they are stored individually under the `exercises` folder, named in the following format: `ex##_algorithm_type_or_name`.
